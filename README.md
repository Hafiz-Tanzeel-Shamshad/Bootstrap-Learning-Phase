# Bootstrap-Learning-Phase 1


This is a simple responsive website built using Bootstrap 5.3.2. The project includes a navigation bar, button groups, and a card component.

## Features

- **Responsive Navigation Bar**:
  - Fixed at the top of the page
  - Includes brand name, navigation links, and a search form
  - Collapsible on smaller screens (mobile-friendly)

- **Button Components**:
  - Grouped buttons using `btn-group`
  - Individual buttons with consistent styling

- **Card Component**:
  - Displays an image with title, text, and a call-to-action button
  - Fixed width of 18rem

## File Structure

- `index.html` - Main HTML file containing all page content
- `style.css` - Custom stylesheet (currently empty/linked but not used)
- `photo.jpg` - Sample image used in the card component

## Technologies Used

- HTML5
- Bootstrap 5.3.2 (CSS and JS via CDN)
- Basic custom CSS (though not currently implemented)

## Setup

No installation required. Simply open `index.html` in any modern web browser.

## Notes

- The photo.jpg appears to be a placeholder image with some text overlay
- The navigation links and buttons are currently non-functional (href="#")
- The project uses Bootstrap's default styling with minimal customization
